### SQL & Data Analysis Project - Paper Company Analysis

Hello, I'm Advitya Kundu. This repository showcases my skills in SQL and Data Analysis through an analysis of a fictitious paper company. The data and analysis are part of a university project, designed to demonstrate the knowledge I've acquired.

#### Project Overview

This project involved analyzing the business operations of a paper company. The dataset used for the analysis is not real but is constructed to mimic real-world business data.

#### Datasets

The datasets used in this project are:
- `accounts.csv`: Business-to-business activities with company names, geographical markers, and contact persons.
- `orders.csv`: Contains order data and its relationship with company names.
- `region.csv`: Contains region names.
- `sales_reps.csv`: Contains information about sales representatives.
- `web_events.csv`: Contains web event data related to the company's operations.

#### SQL Scripts

The analysis was carried out using various SQL scripts, including:
- `Creation.sql`: SQL script for database and table creation.
- `Questions.sql`: Contains SQL queries that answer specific business questions.
- `Views.sql`: SQL script to create views for easier data analysis.

#### Images

Screenshots from the pgAdmin tool during the analysis phase are provided to visualize the execution of the SQL scripts and the results obtained.

#### Tools Used

- SQL
- pgAdmin 4

#### How to Reproduce

1. Setup your SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgAdmin).
2. Run the `Creation.sql` script to create the necessary databases and tables.
3. Import the datasets provided in the `Data` folder.
4. Execute the SQL queries in `Questions.sql` and `Views.sql` to perform the analysis.
5. Review the images for a visual representation of the analysis.
